####Black box test of Bundler's dependency resolution..####

..for the scenario:
```
         b''
        /
  a'   b' -> bb
 /    /
a -> b -> c
```

*Horizonal arrow:* dependency expressed in gemspec.
*Vertical arrow:* dependency not expressed in gemspec, but expressed in Gemfile.

**a's [Gemfile.lock](https://github.com/sveinn/bundler_fun/blob/master/a/Gemfile.lock)**

```b'``` does not appear there (and thus neither do b'' nor bb)

**b's [Gemfile.lock](https://github.com/sveinn/bundler_fun/blob/master/b/Gemfile.lock)**

```b''``` does not appear there

**Â¿Porque?**

As Gems don't normally ship with Gemfiles Bundler only has gemspec to look at to resolve dependencies of dependencies (and thus can't know about b' in the case of a and b'' in the case of b).
